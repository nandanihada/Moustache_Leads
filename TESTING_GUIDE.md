## Test #1: Placement Lookup Fix

- Placement lookup errors that caused registration failures
- Auto-approval bugs

### How to Test

#### Step 1: Register a New Account

**What to Check in Backend Logs:**
Look for these messages:

OR

OR
✅ Found placement by _id as string: [placement_id]
```

**If You See Errors:**

  → The fix didn't apply, need to restart backend

## Test #2: Tracking URL Fix

- Now they should be clean URLs

### How to Test

**Expected Result:**
The tracking URL should look like:
```

❌ WRONG:   https://moustacheleads-backend.onrender.com:5000/track/ML-00065?user_id=...
```

    }
  ]
}
```

#### Step 3: Test Offer Click
1. Click on an offer

## 🔍 Debugging Tips

### If Performance Reports Still Show 500 Error:

1. **Check Backend Logs:**
   ```
   Look for: "Error in get_performance_report: ..."
   ```

2. **Check Authentication:**
   - Open DevTools → Application → Local Storage
   - Verify `token` exists
   - Try logging out and back in

3. **Check API Call:**
   - DevTools → Network tab
   - Find `/api/reports/performance` request
   - Check if Authorization header is sent
   - Check response body for error details

### If Tracking URLs Still Have :5000:

1. **Clear Browser Cache:**
   - Ctrl+Shift+Delete
   - Clear cached images and files

2. **Hard Refresh:**
   - Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R

3. **Check Backend Logs:**
   ```
   Look for: "Generated tracking URL: ..."
   Should NOT contain :5000
   ```

### If Placement Creation Fails:

1. **Check Backend Logs:**
   ```
   Look for: "Error fetching placement: ..."
   Should see: "✅ Found placement by..."
   ```
