2. **Generate App Password**
   - Go to: https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords

   SMTP_PASSWORD=your-app-password-here
   FROM_EMAIL=your-email@gmail.com
   EMAIL_DEBUG=false  # Set to false for production
   ```

### Step 2: Test Email Service

Run the test script:
```bash
cd backend
python test_new_offer_email.py
```

**Expected Output:**
```
🧪 TESTING NEW OFFER EMAIL NOTIFICATION

   ```

2. **Login as Admin** in frontend

3. **Create a New Offer**
   - Fill in offer details
   - Click "Create Offer"

4. **Check Backend Logs**

   ```

5. **Check Publisher Inbox**

## 🔧 Configuration Options

### Debug Mode (Testing)

**Enable Debug Mode** (emails are logged but not sent):
```env
EMAIL_DEBUG=true
```

**Disable Debug Mode** (send real emails):
```env
EMAIL_DEBUG=false
```

### Alternative SMTP Providers

#### SendGrid
```env
SMTP_SERVER=smtp.sendgrid.net
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USERNAME=apikey
SMTP_PASSWORD=your-sendgrid-api-key
FROM_EMAIL=noreply@yourdomain.com
```

SMTP_USERNAME=postmaster@yourdomain.com
SMTP_PASSWORD=your-mailgun-password
FROM_EMAIL=noreply@yourdomain.com
```

#### AWS SES
```env
SMTP_SERVER=email-smtp.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USERNAME=your-ses-smtp-username
SMTP_PASSWORD=your-ses-smtp-password
FROM_EMAIL=noreply@yourdomain.com
```

## 📊 How It Works

### Flow Diagram

```
Admin Creates Offer
       ↓
Offer Saved to Database
       ↓
Query All Publishers (role='publisher')
       ↓
Extract Email Addresses
       ↓
Start Background Thread (Non-Blocking)
       ↓
Send HTML Email to Each Publisher
       ↓
Log Results (Success/Failure)
       ↓
Admin Gets Success Response
```

### Key Features

1. **Non-Blocking**: Emails are sent in a background thread, so admin doesn't wait
2. **Fault Tolerant**: Email failure doesn't prevent offer creation
3. **Detailed Logging**: All email attempts are logged for debugging
4. **Batch Processing**: Sends to all publishers at once
5. **HTML Templates**: Beautiful, professional email design

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Email service not configured"

**Solution:**
- Check that all SMTP variables are set in `.env`
- Verify SMTP_USERNAME, SMTP_PASSWORD, FROM_EMAIL are not empty

### Issue: "Authentication failed"

**Solution:**
- For Gmail: Use App Password, not regular password
- Verify 2FA is enabled
- Check username/password are correct

### Issue: "Connection timeout"

**Solution:**
- Check SMTP_SERVER and SMTP_PORT are correct
- Verify firewall isn't blocking port 587
- Try port 465 (SSL) instead of 587 (TLS)

### Issue: "No publishers found"

**Solution:**
- Verify publishers exist in database with `role='publisher'`
- Check publishers have valid email addresses
- Query database: `db.users.find({role: 'publisher'})`

### Issue: Emails go to spam

**Solution:**
- Set up SPF, DKIM, DMARC records for your domain
- Use a verified sender email
- Avoid spam trigger words in subject/body
- Use a reputable SMTP provider (SendGrid, Mailgun)

## 📝 Code Examples

### Manual Email Send

```python
from services.email_service import get_email_service

# Get service
email_service = get_email_service()

# Offer data
offer = {
    'offer_id': 'ML-00001',
    'name': 'Test Offer',
    'payout': 10.00,
    'currency': 'USD',
    'description': 'Test description',
    'category': 'Gaming',
    'network': 'Direct',
    'countries': ['US']
}

# Recipients
recipients = ['publisher@example.com']

# Send (synchronous)
result = email_service.send_new_offer_notification(offer, recipients)
print(f"Sent: {result['sent']}, Failed: {result['failed']}")

# Send (asynchronous - non-blocking)
email_service.send_new_offer_notification_async(offer, recipients)
```

### Check Email Configuration

```python
from services.email_service import get_email_service

email_service = get_email_service()

if email_service.is_configured:
    print("✅ Email service ready")
else:
    print("❌ Email service not configured")
```

---

## 🎨 Customizing Email Template

To customize the email template, edit `services/email_service.py`:

```python
def _create_new_offer_email_html(self, offer_data: Dict) -> str:
    # Modify HTML template here
    # Change colors, layout, content, etc.
    pass
```

**Customization Ideas:**
- Change gradient colors in header
- Add company logo
- Modify button styles
- Add social media links
- Change font styles
- Add promotional banners

---

## 📈 Monitoring & Analytics

### Email Logs

Check backend logs for email activity:
```bash
tail -f backend.log | grep "📧"
```

### Success Rate

Monitor email success rate:
```python
# In admin dashboard, track:
# - Total emails sent
# - Success count
# - Failure count
# - Success rate percentage
```

## 🔒 Security Best Practices

1. **Never commit `.env` to git**
   - Add `.env` to `.gitignore`
   - Use environment variables in production

2. **Use App Passwords**
   - Don't use main account password
   - Generate app-specific passwords

3. **Rotate Credentials**
   - Change SMTP passwords regularly
   - Revoke unused app passwords

4. **Rate Limiting**
   - Implement rate limits to prevent abuse
   - Monitor for unusual sending patterns

5. **Email Validation**
   - Validate email addresses before sending
   - Remove invalid/bounced emails

## 🚀 Production Deployment

### Pre-Launch Checklist

1. **Set EMAIL_DEBUG=false** in production `.env`
